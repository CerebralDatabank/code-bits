            i   j
1st Person (0): 0,  1,  2,  3,  4,  5
2nd Person (1): 1,  3,  5,  7,  9, 11
3rd Person (2): 2,  5,  8, 11, 14, 17
4th Person (3): 3,  7, 11, 15, 19, 23

Subtracting i from each j list:
 i  j
(0) 0,  0,  1,  2, ...
(1) 0,  2,  4,  6, ...
(2) 0,  3,  6,  9, ...
(3) 0,  4,  8,  12, ...

bool validJ(i, j):
  return (j - i) % (i + 1) is 0

equal to: (j + 1) % (i + 1) is 0




Simplify bool ? !e : e

bool e res
0    0   0
0    1   1
1    0   1
1    1   0

bool XOR e
or
bool != e
